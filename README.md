# SharpPC-Transfer
A simple program that transfers programs over to the Sharp Pocket PC series over serial.

Devices supported such as:  
PC-1600  
PC-E500 series  
PC-13xx series  
PC-1450 / 1475  
PC-E220  
PC-G8xx series  

With the PC-1350/60 needing a baudrate of 1200 (default 9600).  
For help on creating a cable to use for transfer, read http://www.silicium.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=42285  
For the cable, I use a DSD TECH SH-U09C2 USB to TTL Adapter (Firmware must be reprogrammed, but that is explained on the forum post)
